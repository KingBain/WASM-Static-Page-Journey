# Static Dashboard with SQLite and WebAssembly

This repository contains a demo application showcasing a lightweight and cost-effective approach to creating and hosting a dashboard that displays and manipulates data. The solution progresses from a traditional cloud-hosted setup with a PostgreSQL database and a Python Dash app to a fully static, client-side implementation using JavaScript, SQLite, and WebAssembly (WASM). 

## Key Features
- **Static Hosting**: The application can be hosted entirely for free on platforms like GitHub Pages or in a cloud storage bucket, as it requires no backend server.
- **SQLite in the Browser**: Uses SQLite backed by WASM to handle database operations directly in the browser session.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays data on an interactive Plotly graph and supports adding, updating, and deleting data.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for cloud-hosted services like PostgreSQL and app hosting, reducing potential monthly costs from ~$30 to $0.

## Evolution of the Solution
### Original Setup:
- **Components**:
  - Python Dash app hosted in Azure App Service.
  - PostgreSQL database hosted in Azure.
- **Challenges**:
  - High cost of hosting.
  - Complexity of maintaining a PostgreSQL database for static or infrequently changing data.

### Optimized Setup:
- **Components**:
  - Static HTML and JavaScript files served via GitHub Pages or other free hosting solutions.
  - SQLite database converted to a static `.sqlite` file and managed client-side via WASM.
- **Advantages**:
  - All operations run directly in the clientâ€™s browser.
  - No persistent backend or database needed.

## How It Works
1. **Database Initialization**: A PostgreSQL SQL dump was converted into a static SQLite database file.
2. **Client-Side Database**: The SQLite database is loaded into the browser using [sql.js](https://sql.js.org/), a JavaScript library that runs SQLite through WebAssembly.
3. **Dashboard Implementation**: 
   - The application is built with JavaScript and Plotly for interactive data visualization.
   - Users can query, add, and delete data dynamically.
4. **Hosting**: The app consists of two static files:
   - An HTML file for the frontend interface.
   - A pre-generated SQLite database file.

## Running the Demo
To run the demo locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Ensure the `.sqlite` file is in the same directory.
3. Interact with the app: Query data, add new entries, and visualize changes on the graph.

## Benefits of the Approach
- **Zero Backend Dependencies**: No need for hosted databases or servers.
- **Easy Deployment**: Simply upload the HTML and SQLite files to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.
- **Lightweight**: Suitable for small datasets and dashboards where persistence is not a concern.

## Example Use Case
The demo application displays planetary data (e.g., radius, mass, distance from the sun) in an interactive dashboard. Users can:
- Query existing planet data.
- Add new celestial objects.
- Delete objects dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based database.
- **sql.js**: A WebAssembly port of SQLite for client-side database operations.
- **Plotly.js**: A JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the static files.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for persistence using browser storage or serverless options.
- Explore compatibility with larger datasets and offline-first scenarios.
